# Myntra-Online-Retail-Customer-Segmentation-ML
This repository contains an end-to-end data analysis and machine learning project focused on customer segmentation for Myntra, an online fashion retailer. The goal is to analyze customer behavior using sales transaction data and apply clustering and classification techniques to derive meaningful business insights.

---

## 🔍 Objective
- Analyze customer transaction data.
- Segment customers for targeted marketing.
- Predict customer categories using ML models.

---

## 📦 What’s Inside
- `EDA.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis
- `ML_Model.ipynb`: ML implementation with tuning
- `best_model.joblib`: Saved model for deployment
- `unseen_data_predictions.csv`: Sample predictions
- `README.md`: Project overview

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- Joblib for model persistence

---

## 📈 ML Models & Techniques
- Logistic Regression, KMeans, XGBoost
- Hyperparameter tuning (RandomizedSearchCV)
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

---

## 📊 Business Impact
- Improved targeting of high-value customers
- Personalized promotions and retention strategies
- Data-driven marketing decisions

---

## 🚀 Usage
1. Clone the repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/myntra-customer-segmentation.git

   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run notebooks in Jupyter or Google Colab.
